# Flags
Flags is a game application written in Java Swing. The idea is to find by the app choosen by user a national flag after less or equal eight closed questions. There are 23 questions that are scored by algorithm to find such that remaining groups of flags are the same size (divided in half). There are 223 flags so if an app want to guess we need eight questions (there is no way to find all flags in seven questions 2^7=128). This was achieved by asking two questions with conjuction and/or.
